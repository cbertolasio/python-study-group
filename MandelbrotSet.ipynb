        "# The Mandelbrot Set.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the things that really got me interested in math was the Mandelbrot set.  I was a music major in college and taking Calculus.  (Long story.)  On the cover of our text book was a picture of a region of the Mandelbrot set.  One day, after staring at the cover for a while, I decided to do a little digging to see what it was about.  I discovered the incredible beauty and infinite complexity of something that was fairly simple to recreate.  This notebook will guide you through a series of exercises and discussions that end up with some code that can plot the Mandelbrot set, and the closely related Julia sets.  I hope you enjoy the journey.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Mandelbrot set is named after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.  [There is some controversy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mandelbrot-set-1990-horgan/) about Mandelbrot being the person that actually discovered the set.  Regardless of that, the name has stuck.  The set is fairly popular and is easily recognizable to many computer scientists and mathematicians.\n",

        "![alt text](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rSTpMcbNQcKzL0Df_pYz-UdxDaiBv4kR)\n",
        "\n",
        "One really interesting thing about the set is that it is self similar.  In other words, if you \"zoom in\" on the edge of the set, you start to see little copies of the set imbedded in itself.  Another fascinating thing about the set is that the perimeter of the figure is infinite, but the area contained in the set is finite.\n",
        "\n",
        "![alt text](https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1mr-wN2luzCqJGa5aCATXK67k3S7HN5Jl)\n",

        "The algorithm to construct the set is fairly simple.  Before we do that, however, we will need to refresh our memories on complex numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will recall from your advanced calculus class (or perhaps another class that you had prior) that the square root of -1 is defined as:\n",

        "\n",
        "Now, imagine a plane where the x axis is the real numbers and the y axis represents real numbers times i.  This is referred to as the complex plane, and is home to the Mandelbrot set.\n",
        "\n",
        "To render the set, we perform an algorithm for all of the points in the complex plane.  It turns out that the Mandelbrot set is completely contained inside a circle of radius 2 centered on the origin.  For the mathematically inclined, a proof of that [can be found here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/961412/show-that-mandelbrot-set-is-contained-within-the-closed-disc-of-r-2).  Scroll down on that page to see the proof by induction.)  A detailed mathematical analysis can also be found on the [Wolfram mathworld site](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html).\n",

        "The algorithm goes like this:\n",

        "\n",
        "Create this sequence for every point in a square region of $ -2-2i $ to $ 2+2i $ of the complex plane, and add the original point to the set if the sequence doesn't \"blow up\" (aka tend to infinity).  The resulting set is the Mandelbrot set.\n",
        "\n",
        "To render this set in python,  we will need a function that can perform the operation above for complex numbers.  And the first step in that is to be able to compute a new $ Z_{n+1} $ based on a given  $ Z_n $ and $ C $.\n",

        "In the following cell, an array, M, has been created.  The first two components of the array correspond to the INDEX of some real and imaginary numbers.  Now, what does that mean?  Well, consider a region of the complex plane that runs from -2.0 to 2.0 on the real (x) axis, and -2.0 to 2.0 on the imaginary (y) axis.  Now, cut that square up so that it has 400 slots across, and 400 slots vertically. While the slots represent some value between -2 and 2, we can simply enumerate them from 0 to 400.  It turns out there is a very helpful numpy function for this called linspace.\n",

Because we have divided our square into 400x400 units (another way to think of this is we want to end up with a 400x400 pixel image), the point in the center has the index value of 200,200.  Since the 200th row and 200th column corresponds to 0 on the real axis and 0 on the imaginary axis, we would compute the orbit for a point $ C = 0 + 0i $.  That just means we call our orbit function like this:\n",
